# Representation Mixing

This repo has code and pretrained models in support of the paper [Representation Mixing for TTS Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.07240)

# More Info
`pretrained/` contains some information and code for pretrained models, as well as a colab notebook for sampling from the pretrained model

`code/` (will) contain a NON-RUNNABLE code dump of my research library used for training the model. This is only for very, very interested people and for seeing the model definition in code. If you just want sound, use the colab.
